# Cmaj Script Files

The `cmaj` command-line tool can be used to execute a javascript file to perform various Cmajor-related tasks.

To run a script, just invoke the `cmaj play` command with your .js file, e.g.

```shell
$ cmaj play my_script.js
```

There are various built-in javascript bindings available to let you programmatically build and run Cmajor code:

```javascript

//==============================================================================
// Many of the functions return errors when parsing, linking etc.
// Because these errors may contain complex items, they're represented by
// objects, not just strings.
// These helper functions make it easy to find out whether a return value
// is an error, and to dump it out if needed.

function isErrorOrWarning (response)
function isError (response)
function getErrorDescription (error) // converts an error object to a string description
function printError (error)

//==============================================================================
// To compile a Cmajor program, create one of these, and call parse() on it to
// add your source code. If it doesn't return any errors, you can pass it into
// Engine.load()
class Program
{
    constructor()
    release()

    parse (sourceCodeString)    // parses some code, returning an error if there is one
    reset()                     // clears the program object for re-use
    getSyntaxTree (moduleName)  // returns a JSON representation of the full syntax tree of the program
    getBinaryModule()           // returns a conpact binary representation of the program which can be
                                // used in place of the source code for faster loading and obfuscation
}

//==============================================================================
// This represents a Cmajor engine, which can be used to compile Cmajor programs.
// This is basically a binding around the C++ cmaj::Engine class, so for more
// details, see the notes for that class in the C++ API docs.
class Engine
{
    constructor (engineArgs)
    release()
    isValid()
    getBuildSettings()
    setBuildSettings (settings)
    load (program) // takes a Program object, as detailed below.
    unload()
    getInputEndpoints()
    getOutputEndpoints()
    link()
    isLoaded()
    isLinked()
    createPerformer()  // returns a new Performer object (see below) or an error
    getEndpointHandle (endpointID)
    getExternalVariables()
    setExternalVariable(fullyQualifiedName, value)
    getAvailableCodeGenTargetTypes()
    generateCode (target, options)
}

//==============================================================================
// This object is created by Engine.createPerformer() and is used to
// render a processor.
// See also the C++ class cmaj::Performer in the C++ API docs, as this
// object is a wrapper around that class.
class Performer
{
    constructor (performerID)
    release()
    setBlockSize (frames)
    advance()
    getOutputFrames (h)
    getOutputEvents (h)
    getOutputValue (h)
    setInputFrames (h, d)
    setInputValue (h, d, f)
    addInputEvent (h, d)
    getXRuns()
    calculateRenderPerformance (bs, f)
}

//==============================================================================
// A session can be used to load and play a performer. If you want to play a patch,
// you probably don't want to bother with this class directly - instead use the
// Patch and PatchRunner classes, which manage a session for you.
class Session
{
    constructor()
    release()

    setEngine (engine)
    load (program)
    getExternalVariables()
    setExternalVariable (name, value)
    getOutputEndpoints()
    getInputEndpoints()
    getExternalOutputs()
    getExternalInputs()
    connect (s, si, d, di)
    link()
    start()
    stop()
    sendEvent (endpoint, value)
    sendValue (endpoint, value, numFramesToReachValue)
    startServer (address, root)
    openGUI (view)
    closeGUI()
}

//==============================================================================
// This helper class just provides access to the filesystem
class File
{
    constructor (path)          // Creates a file from a path string
    path                        // A property containing the file path as a string

    exists()                    // True if the file exists
    isFolder()                  // True if the file is a folder
    getModificationTime()       // Get the last modification time of the file
    parent()                    // Returns a new File object representing the parent folder
    getChild (relativePath)     // Returns a new File object by appenting this relative path
    getSibling (relativePath)   // Returns a new File object for a sibling file with the given path

    // Reads the content of the file and returns it as a string (if it's valid UTF8) or
    // an array of bytes if not. Returns an error object on failure.
    read()

    // reads an audio file and returns it as an object containing
    // fields for rate, length, and channel data as arrays of floats
    readAudioData (annotations)

    // attempts to overwrite this file with the given string or array of bytes,
    // returning an error on failure
    overwrite (newContent)

    // Scans this folder for children and returns the list as an array of File objects.
    // If shouldFindFolders is true, it only looks for folders, if false, only looks
    // for files. If recursive is true, it's recursive. The wildcard parameter is an
    // optional simple wildcard expression to use.
    findChildren (shouldFindFolders, recursive, wildcard)
}

//==============================================================================
// These functions allow you to use timers, following the standard javascript timer API:

function setInterval (callback, milliseconds)
function setTimeout (callback, milliseconds)
function clearInterval (timerID)
```

Some other optional helper classes are available by importing them.

If you `import_module ("cmaj_patch.js")`, you'll get these classes:

```javascript

// This takes care of loading a patch, given a manifest file.
// As well as parsing and loading, it can create a Session object to play
// it back. If you're playing a patch, using a PatchRunner object is a good
// idea to take care of its lifetime.
class Patch
{
    constructor (file)
    release()

    log (message)

    /// Gives the patch a function to be called when one of the source
    /// files changes. You'd use this to do things like create a new session
    /// when the code changes.
    setFileChangeCallback (callbackFunction)

    /// This will load and release a temporary session in order to just update the input and
    /// output endpoint lists. This is useful for scanning a patch for its properties without
    /// fully loading it.
    ///
    /// Any compile errors are returned, and can be checked for with isError()
    scanForEndpoints()

    /// Creates and returns a new Session object with this program loaded and its
    /// endpoints connected in a sensible way.
    /// Any compile errors are returned, and can be checked for with isError()
    createSession (engineType)

    // Parses the code and returns a Program object for it (or an error)
    createProgram()

    /// Returns an object with a property "messages" containing any errors, and
    /// "output" which is an array of strings or objects containing the generated code
    generateCode (buildSettings, targetType, generatorOptions)
}

/// This helper class opens a patch and runs a timer to monitor any changes to
/// the source files, re-loading a new session if anything changes.
class PatchRunner
{
    constructor (patch, shouldOpenGUI, serverAddress)
    reload()
}
