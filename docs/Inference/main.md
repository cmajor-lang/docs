# Inference in Cmajor

In Cmajor, you may want to run inference on a machine learning model that has been trained for a real time application. Inference in Cmajor is made simple, with integration with the RTNeural and ONNX format.

## RTNeural

[RTNeural](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/RTNeural) is a real-time audio processing inference engine written in C++. It takes a trained network, loads the weights and runs inference on that network.

### RTNeural to Cmajor Python Script

The command line options are given as follows:

```
    This script generates cmajor for the supplied RTNeural model
    Options:

    -h                  Show the help
    --model [s]         Specifies the RTNeural model to convert
    --outputDir [s]     Writes the output as a patch to the given directory
    --name [s]          Name to call the model - defaults to Model
    --useFloat64        By default we use float32, this changes the generated model to float64

    If no patchDir is specified, a single cmajor file is output
```

to run this script, options are given as:

```shell
rtneuralToCmajor.py --model "path/to/your/weights.json" --patchDir "path/to/output/patch"
```

this will output `model.cmajor`, `rtneural.cmajorpatch` and `onnx.cmajor` to the given patch directory. Additional flags such as `--name` can be used to change the name.

#### model.cmajor

`model.cmajor` contains all the nodes, connections and weights required for inference to run.

#### rtneural.cmajor

`rtneural.cmajor` contains all the layers generated in cmajor. This is where nodes in `model.cmajor` are defined.

#### model.cmajorpatch

As with all cmajor manifest files, this file describes the patch's properties and contains links to the other files in the patch.

### Currently supported RTNeural Layers & Activation Functions

| Layers   |
|------------|
|`Dense`|
|`conv1d`|
|`conv2d`|
|`GRU`|
|`PReLU`|
|`BatchNorm1D`|
|`BatchNorm2D`|
|`LSTM`|

| Activations |
|------------|
|`tanh`|
|`ReLU`|
|`Sigmoid`|
|`Softmax`|
|`ELu`|
|`PReLU`|

## ONNX

With our [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) to Cmajor python script, a Cmajor patch is outputted, routing your model through the ONNX operators that have been created in Cmajor. Layers are broken down into mathematical functions, known as operators. The `.onnx` format includes not only the model's architecture but also its weights and other metadata.

### Operators

ONNX operators provide a standardised way to represent these operations, regardless of the deep learning framework used to define or train the model. This means that if you have a neural network model built in one framework (e.g. PyTorch or TensorFlow) and you want to run it on a different platform or framework, you can use ONNX to convert and execute the model seamlessly with Cmajor.

### Using the ONNX to Cmajor Python script

The command line options are given as follows:

```
    This script generates cmajor for the supplied ONNX model
    Options:

    -h                  Show the help
    --model [s]         Specifies the ONNX model to convert
    --patchDir [s]      Writes the output as a patch to the given directory

    If no patchDir is specified, a single cmajor file is output which depends on
    the Cmajor ml operators
```

to run this script, options are given as:

```shell
onnxToCmajor.py --model "path/to/your/model.onnx" --patchDir "path/to/output/patch"
```

this will output `model.cmajor`, `model.cmajorpatch` and `onnx.cmajor` to the given patch directory.

#### model.cmajor

`model.cmajor` contains all the nodes, connections and weights required for inference to run.

#### onnx.cmajor

`onnx.cmajor` contains all the operators generated in cmajor. This is where nodes in `model.cmajor` are defined.

#### model.cmajorpatch

As with all cmajor manifest files, this file describes the patch's properties and contains links to the other files in the patch.

#### Currently supported ONNX Operators:

| Operators   |

|`Tanh`|
|`Reshape`|
|`MatMul`|
|`Gemm`|
|`Add`|
|`Unsqueeze`|
|`Squeeze`|
|`Conv`|
|`GRU`|
|`Pad`|
|`Transpose`|
|`Constant`|
|`LSTM`|
|`Slice`|
|`Gather`|
|`Concat`|
