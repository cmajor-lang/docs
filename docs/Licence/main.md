# Cmajor Licensing

## Different Cmajor licensing options

Cmajor is available under a dual GPLv3/Commercial licensing scheme.

If you fully comply with the terms of the [GPLv3 (or later)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) then you can use Cmajor without needing to contact us.

If you'd like to embed the Cmajor engine in a closed-source product, or to mix it with non-GPL-compliant code, then we will offer a range of commercial licenses to cover many types of use-case.

> We are currently working on our list of commercial license tiers, and payment systems..
> **All the prices and terms will be published here very soon, so watch this space...!**
> (If you're an enterprise user and can't wait to discuss a custom Cmajor license, please contact us directly at info@cmajor.dev)

## License Terms

### IMPORTANT NOTICE: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE CMAJOR LIBRARY:

This Cmajor end-user licence agreement (Agreement) is a legal agreement between you (Licensee or you) and Cmajor Software Ltd (Cmajor Software, Licensor, us or we) for the Cmajor library, which includes source code, tests and examples. For the purposes of this Agreement, the Cmajor library shall be described as “Code”.

#### IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL USERS

THE USAGE OF CMAJOR IS GOVERNED BY THIS DOCUMENT OR THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE CMAJOR LIBRARY, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND ALL INCORPORATED TERMS INCLUDING THE CMAJOR PRIVACY POLICY, AS APPLICABLE, WHICH WILL BIND YOU.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WE WILL NOT LICENSE THE CMAJOR LIBRARY TO YOU AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE OF IT.

If you are accepting the terms of this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to the terms of this Agreement and, in such event, “you” and “Licensee” will refer to that company or other legal entity.

You affirm that you are at least 18 years of age. If you are not 18 years of age but you are at least the age of 13, you may use the Cmajor library only if your parent or guardian agrees to be bound by this Agreement. Parents and guardians of users under the age of 18 agree to the terms of this Agreement, and any reference to “you” shall include the parent or guardian.

You should print a copy of this Licence for future reference.

During the term of this Agreement, you expressly acknowledge and agree that if you are a Personal, Indie, or Pro user and exceed the Revenue Limit thresholds, then you may no longer use that tier of the Program, and you must either: (a) purchase a different Cmajor licence (if eligible); (b) or cease distributing your Applications; or (c) license your Applications under the GPLv3 License. We may monitor your compliance with and enforce these restrictions and requirements as described in clause 10.4 below.

### 1. Grant and scope of Licence


1.1. Each Cmajor licence includes New Features and Minor Updates for that specific Cmajor license, but does not include New Releases.

1.2. Each Cmajor licence comes with a specific number of seats for users to utilize the Code, and you agree that only one user may utilize the Code per seat offered in your specific Cmajor licence for the purposes of coding and development.

1.3. You may not use the Personal, Indie, Pro (1, 2, or 3), Enterprise or Education licenses simultaneously. You may not combine or integrate your Licensee Content developed with one tier of the Code (e.g., the Personal tier) simultaneously with any of your Licensee Content developed with another tier (e.g., the Indie or Enterprise tier).

1.4. You may sell or distribute Applications using the Code that incorporates your Licensee Content to end users, provided that you adhere to the terms in this Agreement, including paying applicable Fees once you hit your Revenue Limit. You may not sell, sublicense, or otherwise distribute the Code or Software on their own.

1.5. Where you have licensed the Education tier, you may be requested to provide certain documentation before being approved, and Cmajor Software Ltd reserves the right in its sole discretion to decline authorization for an Education tier license.

1.6. Remember, unless you upgrade to the Indie, Pro, or Enterprise tiers, if you exceed the Revenue Limit for the Personal iter, then your licence becomes the GPLv3 License which is an open-source licence and requires, among other things, that you make your source code available and license modified files and larger derived works (including all linked code) under the same terms of the GPLv3. Please review the terms of the GPLv3 carefully.

1.7 You may not create Applications directed toward Children, unless you fully comply with the COPPA rules, including without limitation obtaining verifiable parental consent, as further described in clause 10 below. You are responsible for any liabilities arising out of a violation of COPPA.

1.8. Each particular type of license comes with certain features as is described further in this chart, and these may include adding Cmajor branding to your Application.

1.9. If you subcontract development of an Application, you must have at least one Cmajor license of a suitable type (matching revenue/funding limits as per the table) in order to distribute Applications.

1.10. If a New Release of Cmajor is made, any support will be for the New Release.

### 2. Restrictions

2.1. to comply with all applicable laws, including all technology control or export laws and regulations;

2.2. to supervise and control use of the Code and ensure that the Code is used by your employees and representatives in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

2.3. not to use the Code in connection with any Licensee Content, Application or otherwise that infringes or misappropriates any third party right, including any intellectual property, property, privacy, contract or other proprietary right or for any other illegal or immoral purpose;

### 3. Fees and Minimum Commitments.

3.1. Where you have purchased a Cmajor subscription licence, you agree to pay the subscription Fee from the first day of purchase, and recurring every month on the same day, for the Minimum Commitment, where applicable.

3.2. The subscription Fee shall be the Fee as notified to you on the Website at the time you purchase the Cmajor subscription licence.

3.3. All payments of Fees are non-refundable.

3.4. All Fees payable under this Agreement are exclusive of VAT or any relevant local sales taxes, for which you shall be responsible.

3.5. Without limiting all available remedies, in the event Cmajor Software discovers that you have exceeded your Revenue Limit in breach of this Agreement, you shall be liable for the amount of Fees due if you had properly purchased a Cmajor licence, the amount of any audit, and internal administration costs in the amount of no less than \$1,000 USD.

### 4. Support

4.1. We shall have no obligation to provide support and maintenance services to you. You may participate in our online support forum in accordance with our forum policies. Further support and maintenance services may be offered at our sole discretion, and may be offered as a feature of the Cmajor licence you purchase.

### 5. Intellectual Property Rights

### 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

All other conditions, warranties or other terms whether express or implied, or incorporated into this Agreement or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, including without limitation warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose are hereby excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law, including the implied conditions, warranties or other terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose or the use of reasonable skill and care.

6.2. You acknowledge that the Code has not been developed to meet your individual requirements and that it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Code meet your requirements.

## FAQs

### Can a Cmajor licence be shared by multiple developers?

No. Each developer requires an exclusive licence.

### It is possible to reassign licences amongst members of an organisation?

If an organisation has purchased a set of licences for their software development team, then when a team member leaves the team their licence seat can be reassigned to a new team member. Reassigning licences can be done using the account dashboard of the licence purchaser.

Reassigning licences should not be done very frequently. This is not a mechanism designed to optimise the minimum number of licences required. If you have multiple developers regularly, but non-concurrently, contributing code to software containing Cmajor then you will require multiple licences.

### Is the total annual revenue or funding limit determined solely by sales of software containing Cmajor?

No. The total annual revenue or funding limit is that of the whole organisation or individual that owns the Cmajor licence. If your team or project is a small part of a large organisation then you will likely require a Pro licence. The revenue or funding limit is not based upon revenue generated by software containing Cmajor nor the budget of a particular team or individual within an organisation.

### Do I need a Cmajor licence if I am not releasing products containing Cmajor?

Cmajor is dual licensed under both our commercial licences and the GPLv3.

This means that you can choose to use Cmajor under the terms of the GPLv3 licence. If you are not "propagating" or "conveying" closed-source software containing Cmajor outside of your organisation then you may not be violating the terms of the GPLv3. The creation and use of "in-house" tools and the internal development of "pre-release" software (before it goes out to external testers) is usually permitted under the GPLv3. Please refer to the GPLv3 terms for the full details.

If you are not using Cmajor under the GPLv3 then you will require a commercial licence. You will need to maintain a licence for at least the duration over which you are distributing closed-source binaries containing Cmajor.

### Can a Cmajor Educational licence be used by students?

No. Our Educational licences are offered to bona fide educational institutions and come with the number of seats requested by the educational institution. Institutions requesting Educational licences must agree to submit any requested documentation to show proof of a bona fide educational institute.

### How many licenced developer seats do I need?

By default all developers contributing any source code to software containing cmajor will require a licence.

However, there are certain situations where this doesn't make much sense. If the software development team using Cmajor is a small fraction of the overall software development team, and the use of Cmajor is not central to the overall product, then it is more appropriate that only the developers in the team using Cmajor directly will require licences. If you'd like to discuss what might constitute a fair number of seats for your situation, contact us at info@cmajor.dev.

While Cmajor licences can be infrequently reassigned between developers, our licensing is not designed to be flexible with regards to team size. If a product containing Cmajor ever had a large development team then it is the maximum concurrent size of the development team that fixes the number of licence seats required. If the team size is subsequently reduced to just a few people providing product maintenance post-release the product still requires the larger number of licence seats for the entire duration over which the product is distributed.

### Do I need a Cmajor licence to sell Cmajor-based software created by another entity?

No. The software needs to be licensed by all the contributors to the source code. If you have not contributed to any of the source code then you do not require a licence.

However, you must ensure that the software is appropriately licensed for the whole duration over which you are distributing it. If any of the contributors are third parties then the distributor/seller is legally obliged to ensure that the corresponding licences are perpetal, rather than per-month subscription licences.

### I want to hire a contractor to contribute to software containing cmajor. Do I need a licence or does the contractor need a licence?

You can use either option.

If the hiring organisation purchases a licence then that licence can be used by the contractor for the duration of their work. When the contractor has finished the work the licence can then be re-assigned to a different contractor. If the hiring organisation will have a fixed maximum number of contractors working simultaneously then this licensing model may be the most appropriate.

It is also possible for contractors to have their own individual licences. In this situation the relevant revenue or funding limit will be that of the contractor, so it may be possible for contractors to use Indie licences where the revenue of the hiring organisation would exceed the Indie funding or revenue limit. However, the hiring organisation is responsible for ensuring that the software is appropriately licensed for the whole duration over which it is distributed (see the answer to the previous question above).
