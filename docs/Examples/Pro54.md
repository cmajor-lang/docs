# Pro-54

This example patch is a Cmajor port of the Native Instruments [Pro-53](https://www.vintagesynth.com/native-instruments/pro-53), which was originally released around the year 2002.

The DSP is a fairly direct port to Cmajor of an never-released internal C++ port of the original synth.. We haven't attempted to do anything clever in terms of modularising the code into Cmajor graph/processors, and have left most of the original structure, even including a 1000-line main() function!

The GUI was recreated in HTML/javascript using mostly salvaged low-res bitmaps for that authentically vintage feel..
