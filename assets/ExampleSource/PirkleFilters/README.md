## Filters by Will Pirkle ported to CMajor

This example is by [Oli Larkin](https://github.com/olilarkin).

These filters are ported from the C++ projects in Will Pirkle's books
and the application notes on his website

Uncomment/comment the filters in the FilterTester graph to try the different types. You may also need to comment/uncomment parameters
depending on the filter.
